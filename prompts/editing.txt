You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to improve a prompt based on analysis of its failures.

CURRENT PROMPT:
```
{current_prompt}
```

ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS:
{error_analysis}

SUGGESTED DIRECTION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
{suggested_direction}

SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS:
{specific_suggestions_block}

EXAMPLES OF FAILURES TO ADDRESS:
{failure_examples_block}

YOUR TASK:
Generate {num_variants} improved versions of the prompt that address the problems identified above.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each variant should be a COMPLETE, FUNCTIONAL prompt (not just modifications)
2. Apply the suggested improvements while maintaining the core purpose
3. Make variants somewhat diverse - try different approaches to solving the same problems
4. Focus on being concrete and specific in instructions
5. Consider adding examples, constraints, or clarifications where needed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each variant, use this exact format:

VARIANT [number]:
CHANGES MADE: [Brief description of what you changed and why]
OPERATION TYPE: [Choose one: add_instruction, modify_instruction, rephrase, add_example, add_constraint, clarify, restructure]
PROMPT:
```
[The complete improved prompt here]
```

Now generate {num_variants} variants:
