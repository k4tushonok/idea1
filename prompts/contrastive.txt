You are an expert prompt engineer. Analyze how well the current prompt distinguishes between similar but different cases.

CURRENT PROMPT:
```
{current_prompt}
```

HARD NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (should be rejected/marked as incorrect):
{hard_negatives_block}

HARD POSITIVE EXAMPLES (should be accepted/marked as correct):
{hard_positives_block}

Analyze:
1. What makes the hard negatives and hard positives similar yet different?
2. What discriminative features or instructions is the prompt missing?
3. How can the prompt be modified to better distinguish these cases?

Please provide your analysis in the following structured format:

## ERROR ANALYSIS
Describe what specifically is going wrong with the current prompt. Be concrete and specific.
- What patterns do you see in the failures?
- What is the prompt missing or doing incorrectly?
- Are there any ambiguities or unclear instructions?

## SUGGESTED DIRECTION
Describe the semantic direction in which the prompt should be modified.
- What concepts or constraints should be added?
- What aspects need clarification or emphasis?
- What examples or patterns should be incorporated?

## SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
Provide 3-5 concrete, actionable suggestions for modifying the prompt:
1. [First specific suggestion]
2. [Second specific suggestion]
3. [Third specific suggestion]
...

## PRIORITY
Rate the urgency of these changes from 0.0 to 1.0, where:
- 1.0 = Critical issues that must be fixed immediately
- 0.7 = Important improvements that will significantly help
- 0.5 = Moderate improvements
- 0.3 = Minor refinements
Priority: [your rating]

Focus on being specific, actionable, and grounded in the examples provided.
