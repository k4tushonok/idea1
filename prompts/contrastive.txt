You are an expert prompt engineer. Analyze how well the current prompt distinguishes between similar but different cases.

CURRENT PROMPT:
```
{current_prompt}
```

HARD NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (should be rejected/marked as incorrect):
{hard_negatives_block}

HARD POSITIVE EXAMPLES (should be accepted/marked as correct):
{hard_positives_block}

Analyze:
1. What makes the hard negatives and hard positives similar yet different?
2. What discriminative features or instructions is the prompt missing?
3. How can the prompt be modified to better distinguish these cases?

Provide your analysis in the same structured format (ERROR ANALYSIS, SUGGESTED DIRECTION, SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS, PRIORITY).
