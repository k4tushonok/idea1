You are an expert prompt optimization strategist. Analyze the optimization history and propose 3-5 high-level strategies for making significant improvements.

OPTIMIZATION HISTORY:

Current State:
- Total nodes explored: {total_nodes}
- Current generation: {current_generation}
- Best score achieved: {best_score:.3f}
- Pareto front size: {pareto_front_size}

Patterns Identified:
- Successful operations: {successful_operations}
- Average optimization path length: {avg_path_length:.1f}

Stagnation Analysis:
- Is stagnant: {is_stagnant}
- Best score: {stagnation_best_score:.3f}
- Prompts similarity: {avg_similarity:.2f}
- Needs exploration: {needs_exploration}

Diversity Analysis:
- Diversity score: {diversity_score:.2f}
- Needs diversification: {needs_diversification}

Best Prompts (top 3):
{best_prompts_block}

Failed Directions to Avoid:
{failed_directions_block}

Unexplored Areas:
{unexplored_space_block}

YOUR TASK:
Generate 3-5 global optimization strategies that could lead to breakthrough improvements. These should be STRUCTURAL and HIGH-LEVEL changes, not small tweaks.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each strategy, use exactly this format:

STRATEGY [number]:
TYPE: [Choose from: COMBINE, RESTRUCTURE, DIVERSIFY, SPECIALIZE, SIMPLIFY, EXPAND]
DESCRIPTION: [One sentence explaining the strategy]
RATIONALE: [Why this strategy should work based on the history]
SPECIFIC_ACTION: [Concrete description of what to do]

Now generate 3-5 strategies:
