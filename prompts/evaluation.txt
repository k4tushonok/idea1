You are an expert in prompt engineering.

Your task is to estimate how different two prompts are in terms of:
    - intent
    - constraints
    - structure
    - examples and formatting

Rate the difference on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 where:
    - 0.0 means the prompts are effectively identical
    - 1.0 means the prompts are completely different

Return ONLY a single floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.

    PROMPT A:
    ```
    {prompt1}
    ```

    PROMPT B:
    ```
    {prompt2}
    ```
